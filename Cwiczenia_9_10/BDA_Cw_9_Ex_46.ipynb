    "or H-spread, is a measure of statistical dispersion, being equal to the difference between 75th and\n",
    "25th percentiles, or between upper and lower quartiles, IQR = Q3 âˆ’ Q1. In other words, the IQR is\n",
    "the first quartile subtracted from the third quartile; these quartiles can be clearly seen on a box plot\n",
    "on the data. It is a trimmed estimator, defined as the 25% trimmed range, and is a commonly used\n",

    "The $\\textbf{IQR}$ is a measure of variability, based on dividing a data set into quartiles. Quartiles divide\n",
    "a rank-ordered data set into four equal parts. The values that separate parts are called the first,\n",
